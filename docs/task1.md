# Using Notion with a Template

Notion is an all-in-one workspace for everyone who needs to organize their information. 
It provides a variety of templates for different purposes. 

For example, you might want to organize your Notion for notetaking purposes. Or you might want to have a page for listing out your daily to-do tasks. 

Here we will explore and learn how to find and use in-app templates and how to import community made templates by other users.

## Starter Templates

Upon signing up for Notion, you will see a collection of 5 templates already provided for you on the side bar. 
Here's how you can use them to organize your information. 

--- 

Here is what your page looks like when you first register for Notion. 

>![Starter Template](/lost-ark-studio\docs\images\task1\starterTemplate.png "Starter Template")

In this example we are going to select the `Task List` template from the side bar to create a to-do list.


1. Click on `✔ Task List` option on the left sidebar. 


>![Task List](/lost-ark-studio\docs\images\task1\taskList.png "Click on task list on the left sidebar")
<br />
<br />

2. Click `+ New` on the Task List page and type a name for your to do list.

>![Add Task](/lost-ark-studio\docs\images\task1\createTask.png "Add a task with the + New button on the task list page")

And here you go! You just made your first Notion board with some tasks to do.

## Find and Use In-App Templates

Sometimes we want to look for a more specific template to suit our organizing habits. Notion provides more than 50 built in templates already made for you to use. 

---

1. Click on `Templates` option on the left sidebar. 
>![templates](/lost-ark-studio/docs/images/task1/templates.png "add template page")

By doing so, you will see many types of template for different occasions. We see the "Class Notes" template shown here.
>![template selection](/lost-ark-studio/docs/images/task1/templateSelection.png "template selection page")


2. Click on  `Use this template`  on top left of the page to choose the template.
>![choosing template](/lost-ark-studio/docs/images/task1/selectTemplate.png "selecting your template")

Congratulations! You've just created your new Notion board with the selected template that looks like this: 
>![choosen template](/lost-ark-studio/docs/images/task1/chosenTemplate.png "successfully selected your built in template")

Alternatively, you can also click on `+ Add a page` to create an "Untitled page" and select a built-in template.

>![add page](/lost-ark-studio/docs/images/task1/addPage.png "using add page to chose a template")

## Import Community-Made Templates

In addition to the in-app templates, you can also duplicate a public page made by other users into your own Notion as a template. 

1. Go to https://www.notion.so/templates to view templates available.

2. Click on a template that you would like to import. Here we will select "Branch's engineering roadmap" template.

>![Branch's engineering roadmap](/lost-ark-studio/docs/images/task1/publicTemplate.png "choosing a public template")

3. Choose `duplicate template` to copy the template to your own Notion board.

>![duplicate template](/lost-ark-studio/docs/images/task1/duplicateTemplate.png "duplicate template to own Notion board")

**Note**: it may take a few moments for the template to load onto your Notion board.

Congratulations! You just loaded a community-made template onto your own Notion board!


## Removing a Template

Don't like the starter templates? Changed your mind about adding a template to your Notion? No worries. Removing a template is just as easy as adding one.

---

1. Hover your mouse on the template you would like to delete. 

2. Click on the `•••` that appears over the template title.

>![selecting template to delete](/lost-ark-studio/docs/images/task1/hover.png "selecting template to delete")

3. Click `Delete` to remove the template from your Notion board.

>![deleting the template](/lost-ark-studio/docs/images/task1/selectDelete.png "deleting template")

Congratulations! You deleted your Notion board.
