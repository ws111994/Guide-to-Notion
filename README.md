### Overview of Notion Instruction Guide

Hello reader, our guide on Notion is meant to provide you with a basic and general understanding of how to use Notion as well as how to use basic functions to use Notion to the fullest.

The things we want to teach you in this site include how to:
- Installing Notion or using it on web version,
- using Notion with a template,
- create, modify, your own task board, and
- sharing pages and collaborating with other users.

### Our Collaboration process

At the early stage of this guide, we would analyze what the user will use the more in Notion as well as the essential needs for basic day to day Notion users.

Due to COVID-19, we did not have the chance to communicate in person and we opted to use Discord and Email as our main form of communication outside of classes.

We deliberately used Discord to communicate effectively given our circumstances. Our team agree that _communication would be the most important_ part in finishing and creating a user centered instruction guide.

### How our team created the guide
In the process of composing this guide, we mainly used Github as the editor, and with sufficient amount of screenshot of Notion, we have come together with easy to follow guide.

#### Using Markdown for the first time

It was our team's first time using the Markdown. 

Our team was unfamiliar with the concept of writing insturction with markdown before creating this guide. Our team invested fair bit of time to learn how to format and use certain syntax to create a readable guide with Markdown.

Our team learned and implemented the use of headings, font weights, lists, indentation, breaks, code blocks, tables, and integrating links, images and gifs in our guide.

#### Using a Theme

Our team opted to use one of the free themes provided from Jekyll to allow us to change the style and look of the guide. Our team agreed to use the current theme due to how this theme is simple and easy to read.

To customize Jekyll theme to fit out own need, we forked the Just the Docs theme and configured the yaml file to allow us to make all necessary code changes.

### Conclusion
Completing this guide using markdown was not easy at first. 
However, through helping each other as a team, we were able to complete our guide on time with good quality of work.

Working as a team is always harder than working individually since you have to cooperate on many things.

Because we were working on several projects together for this course, 
we came to adapt to how other team members work and were able to easily come to an agreement with each other.

Lost Ark Studio was extremely beneficial to team members that are involved and taught us better how to work as a team. 
We are looking forward to working on a project together if we are ever given the chance to.

Thank you for reading our Notion guide and we hope that you can utilize Notion better by following our instructions.
