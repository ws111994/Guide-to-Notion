# Sharing Pages With Others

It is possible to use Notion as the all-in-one-place app instead of other useful apps. For instance, Notion can replace Google Docs, Google Sheets, Evernote, Pocket, Google Calendar, etc.

It is easy to share the documents and all of the added templates. As a result, Notion is a great tool for the internal wiki. Besides, the interface for wiki-building capabilities is also quite convenient.

## Share menu


Notion is built to be super collaborative, so there's a number of ways to share the content you create with other people. Our permission levels ensure that they access this content exactly the way you want them to.

First, here's a quick tour of the Share menu, which can be clicked at the top right of your page. On mobile, click the share icon next to the ••• at the top right for the same options.

In order to access the share functionality, the `Share` button can be clicked at the top right of your page. On mobile, an `•••` button can be seen at the same spot.

This is an example for different parties that may have access to this page.

- `Share to web` is turned off
- The dropdown menus on the right let you set their level of access.
- `Copy link` copies the page's unique URL to your clipboard so you can share it with whoever you want. 
- `Invite` button will add people both inside or outside you workspace to a page by their email address.



## Share with individual

You can share the current Notion page with other people by adding their email address in the share menu. Target group could be individual person, a group specified in Notion contact, or within certain workspace.

After clicking the `Invite` button on the top right, this submenu will pop up. Enter the email address to add them to the shared list.

 the dropdown menu to the left of `Invite` button provides different access level to the shared page.

>![dropDown](https://github.com/ws111994/lost-ark-studio/blob/gh-pages/docs/images/task3/dropDown.png?raw=true "dropDown")

When you are ready to share the page, click the `Invite` button will send an email to target email address with a share link to access the current page. Or you can click the `Copy link` on the bottom right and send the url manually.

## Share with a group

To make it easier to share with commonly-used groups (i.e. your study group or work group), you can create different groups in Notion and add different members to desired groups. 

**Note**: only workspace admins can create or edit groups.

In order to create a group in Notion, please follow the steps below:

**1.** Go to `Settings & Members` at the top of you left-hand sidebar.

>![settings](https://github.com/ws111994/lost-ark-studio/blob/gh-pages/docs/images/task3/settings.png?raw=true "settings")
<br />
<br />

**2.** Select the `Members` tab in the sidebar.



**3.** Select the `Groups` header.



**4.** Click `Create a group`. Name and icon of the group is customizable.


**5.** Under the new group, click `Add members` to add as many members as you want.


**6.** You can also `Remove` any group member.
